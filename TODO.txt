# TODO 

## Objective
TM: I'm using this as a rolling list of tasks that need to be closed.
    Feel free to add to it or tackle something on it. Just make sure
    to communicate in one of our channels so we don't double-book.
    No need to use it if you don't like, it's more here for my 
    convenience than anything. Whatever suits your flow :)

## List 

### Poopy broswer icon - `favicon.ico` is blurry and unrecognizeable. Could
    be a number of things. Maybe try the svg file? (`src\logo.svg`)
