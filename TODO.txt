# TODO Test

## Objective
TM: I'm using this as a rolling list of tasks that need to be closed.
    Feel free to add to it or tackle something on it. Just make sure
    to communicate in one of our channels so we don't double-book.
    No need to use it if you don't like, it's more here for my 
    convenience than anything. Whatever suits your flow :)

## List 
(`BATTLE` - An immediate need; `MISSION` - An eventual need; `QUEST` - A nice to have; `SIDESTORY` - Backburner)

### Poopy broswer icon - `favicon.ico` is blurry and unrecognizeable. Could
    be a number of things. Maybe try the svg file? (`src\logo.svg`)

### `OSBarChart.jsx` Component ### - TM: I should be on top of these

    #### DONE - Date to Weekday Function #### - MISSION
        to find weekday value of given date in `OSBarChart.jsx` --- Sample
        data has weekday values but input will inevitably be in date format

    #### DONE - Annotation Text #### - QUEST
        Conditionally format above or below x-axis inversely to data value as to not cover up the info 
        - May not be necessary - 

    #### DONE - Round Tooltips Values #### - MISSION - (DONE)
        Tooltips are rounding to whole numbers... need to be 2 decimal (currency)

    #### Populate Chart w/ Real Data #### - BATTLE
        needs to be plugged into middleware routes... just sample data now

    #### DONE - Negative Values in () - MISSION
        Format negative datalabels in () rather than with -

    #### DONE - Look into Apexcharts License - MISSION
        May be licensing requirements for the software (MIT License)

    #### DONE - Black Titles to Gray-800 - MISSION
        Make it look consistent with SideBar

### `SideBar.jsx` Component ### - 

    #### Add Lucide License Requirements - MISSION
        Lucide requires certain acknowledgements (ISC License)

    #### Connect 'Close Day' Items - MISSION
        Close Day item is currently connected to Open Day page. I think
        it's cuz we don't have a Close Day page lol.

    #### Parent Items Bold Text When Open - QUEST
        If parent item is open, make text the darker gray to signify it is parent.

    #### Not Mobile-Responsive - BATTLE
        Hopefully an easy fix with Tailwind

### `HorizontalNav.js` Component ### - 
    
    #### Menu Focus Loss Bug - BATTLE
        The focus styling for the stores icon button is only handling clicks ON it,
        buuuuuuut the menu that comes up can lose focus when user clicks anywhere -
        not just on the stores icon button - at which point the styling needs to be
        turned off but it is not

    #### Menu Items Rounded Corners - QUEST
        When menu items are hovered, their corner styling disappears

    #### Populate with User Stores - BATTLE
        Just a hardcoded store right now

### Handle invalid user login

### Refactor assets into their own directory
